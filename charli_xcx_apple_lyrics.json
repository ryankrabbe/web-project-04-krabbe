{"lyrics": "I guess the apple don't fall far from the tree\r\n'Cause I've been looking at you so long\r\nNow I only see me\r\nI wanna throw the apple into the sky\r\nFeels like you never understand me\r\nSo I just wanna drive\n\n\n\nTo the airport, the airport\n\nThe airport, the airport\n\n\n\nI guess the apple could turn yellow or green\n\nI know there's lots of different nuances\n\nTo you and to me\n\nI wanna grow the apple, keep all the seeds\n\nBut I can't help but get so angry\n\nYou don't listen to me\n\n\n\nTo the airport, the airport\n\nThe airport, the airport\n\nThe airport, the airport\n\nThe airport, the airport\n\n\n\nI'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night\n\nI'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night\n\n\n\nI think the apple's rotten right to the core\n\nFrom all the things passed down\n\nFrom all the apples coming before\n\nI split the apple down symmetrical lines\n\nAnd what I find is kinda scary\n\nMakes me just wanna drive\n\n(Drive, drive, drive, dr-dr-dr-drive, drive, drive)\n\n(I'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night)\n\n(I'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night)\n\n(Drive, drive, drive, dr-dr-dr-drive, drive, drive)\n\n\n\nI know where you're go\n\nWhen you're feeling alone\n\nWhen you're feeling alone, do you\n\nI know where you're go\n\nWhen you're feeling alone\n\nWhen you're feeling alone, do you\n\n(Do you, do you, do you, do you)\n\n(Do you, do you, do you, do you)\n\n(Do you, do you, do you, do you)\n\n(Do you, do you, do you, do you)\n\n(Do you, do you, do you, do you)\n\n(Do you, do you, do you, do you)\n\n(Do you, do you, do you, do you)\n\n(Do you, do you, do you, do you)\n\n(Do you, do you)"}
