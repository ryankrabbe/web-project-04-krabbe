{"lyrics": "I want you to stay\r\n'Til I'm in the grave\r\n'Til I ride away, dead and buried\r\n'Til I'm in the casket you carried\r\nIf you go, I'm going too, oh\r\n'Cause it was always you, oh\n\nAnd if I'm turning blue, please don't save me\n\nNothing left to lose without my baby\n\n\n\nBirds of a feather, we should stick together\n\nI know I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone\n\nCan't change the weather, might not be forever\n\nBut if it's forever, it's even better\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know what I'm crying for\n\nI don't think I could love you more\n\nIt might not be long, but, baby, I\n\n\n\nI'll love you 'til the day that I die\n\n'Til the day that I die\n\n'Til the light leaves my eyes\n\n'Til the day that I die\n\n\n\nI want you to see, oh\n\nAll you mean to me, oh\n\nYou wouldn't believe if I told ya\n\nWho we would become, laments I wrote ya\n\nBut you're so full of shit, oh\n\nTell me it's a bit, oh\n\nSay you don't see it, your mind's all brooding\n\nSay you wanna quit, don't be stupid\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know what I'm crying for\n\nI don't think I could love you more\n\nMight not be long, but, baby, but I\n\nDon't wanna say goodbye\n\n\n\n(Birds of a feather, we should stick together)\n\n'Til the day that I die\n\n(I know I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone)\n\n'Til the light leaves my eyes\n\n(Can't change the weather, might not be forever)\n\n'Til the day that I die\n\nBut if it's forever, it's even better\n\n\n\nHow do you do nothing?\n\nYou had the same look in your eyes\n\nI love you, don't act so surprised"}
